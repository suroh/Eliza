# Eliza
Eliza, the original computer therapist (not certified). I've re-written this program but kept the core phrases the same. 


This program is still be updated as of (December 18th 2017). So far you'll note by viewing the code that it's more "Modern" in the sense that it's not a cluster fuck of exposed useless functions. 

However, the key difference is that Eliza speaks to the user. Yes, "she" now has a voice! Furthermore, the option exists for the user to interact with Eliza via microphone. Eliza will hear what you say and respond in turn.


The program is a work in progress but as of now everything works. This was written for and on linux so if you're using this on windows or mac it not run by default. Nor should it run by default on a linux system, for more information on this please see the commented section "Requirements" at the bottom of the source code. 

If you do use it on windows you may have to make minor changes but nothing major this applies to macs as well. For linux users, just full the little guide in the requirements section and you'll be talking with Eliza in no time!
